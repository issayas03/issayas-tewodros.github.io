/* LOOPS


* What are Javascript Loops?


*/


// 1. 
//Loops are used to repeat a certain task written inside it's block, as long as specific conditions are met. 

//Everything written inside of the curly brackets will repeat




//2.  
//There are 3 types of loops.. Each written in their own syntax

/* 
     For loops
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {...i} ////iterate through Array, Strings, or for incrementer

    For..in loops
for (key in obj){...obj[key]} to iterate through objects

    While loops 
while (i < 10){  repeat specific tasks
    ....
    i++;
}
    */



//3.
//For loops are used to iterate strings, arrays, and numbers

//4.
//For in loops are used to iterate through the keys of an object

//5.
//While loops are just used to repeat specific actions


//--
// By repeatively increasing an increment we are able to access multiple values from within an Array, Object, or String
//through that incrementer 

//Example) instead of string[0] to get "s" we could do string[i] inside of a for loop and access all values


//6. 
//Items that are written in a loop are block scoped
